description: Load your daily Working Memory briefing for session context
---

Read your daily Working Memory briefing to understand current context, priorities, and recent activity.

## Usage

```bash
cat ~/ai-now/memory.md 2>/dev/null || echo "Working Memory not available. Ensure Nowledge Mem Background Intelligence is enabled."
```

## What You'll See

Working Memory is a daily briefing generated by Nowledge Mem's Background Intelligence. It contains:

- **Focus areas** — topics you've been actively working on
- **Priorities and flags** — contradictions, stale knowledge, items needing verification
- **Recent activity** — memories created, evolved, or crystallized
- **Deep links** — `nowledgemem://memory/<id>` links to referenced memories

## When to Use

- **Session start** — read this first to understand what the user has been working on
- **After context compaction** — re-read to restore awareness of current priorities
- **Before making decisions** — check if there are relevant flags or recent insights

## Notes

- Working Memory lives at `~/ai-now/memory.md` — it's a plain markdown file
- Updated automatically each morning by Background Intelligence
- If not available, the user may not have Background Intelligence enabled or configured a remote LLM

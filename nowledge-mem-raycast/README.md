## What Is Working Memory?

Each morning, Nowledge Mem generates a briefing at `~/ai-now/memory.md` summarizing what you're focused on, what needs attention, and what changed. Any AI tool connected via MCP (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) reads this file at session start — your assistant knows your context before you type a word.
